Well. Where to begin. Let's just say this; avoid this movie at allcosts. It's based on a cartoon series. The movie makes the cartoon looklike Hamlet. Filled with emasculated actors who seem embarrassed to behere, lousy camera work, terrible music, and enough product placement tomake you want to never visit Yahoo! again, this movie is really thebottom of the barrel. To quote the New Yorker, Matthew Broderick andRupert Everett mug their way through this picture with the gay abandonof men who have spotted a rare species of paycheck in the distance."They should pay us some of the millions they earned for watching it.Awful.
