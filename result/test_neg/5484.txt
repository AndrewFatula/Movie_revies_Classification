They said it would be a film greater than Turks Fruit. How darethey? It's not even 10% of this classic. Bad acting. The only character i felt sympathy for was the oneplayed by Angela Schijf. Her acting was the best in the whole film. The story could've been interesting, but it wasn't. Some scenes were very beautiful filmed (lights and camera), (theopening scene for example), but the bad acting made the magicdisappear.I really don't understand why so many people voted this film sogood.
