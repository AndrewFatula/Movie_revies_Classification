Frankly I met real Han Su Ying before and seeing her portrayed by an American actress which has no resemblance of anything Chinese makes my head spin while I am watching this movie Why can't Hollywood get Nancy Kwan instead .... at least its more true to the story...cos for goodness sake...Dr Han Su Ying is Chinese I know cos I have meet her in personand looking at the whole cast....so few Asian faces in a movie about a Asian love story makes me wonder too I think the acting is good but without real Asian faces in a Asian love story makes the plot so corny and a whole load of Baloneyits just like another movie I know of ' THE CONQUEROR' imagine my eyes pop out when I see John Wayne as Genghis Khan!!!!!and to make matter worst ....how on earth can a man born an bred in MONGOLIAN STEPPES come up with a Alabama southern accent??? !! and a cheap imitation of anything AsianGood GriefI am not surprise that one day I will see Dr Martin Luther King Jr being played by One of the boys from the black and white minstrel showWould love to see thatand laugh the whole roof off !!!Cheers
