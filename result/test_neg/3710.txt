Hearing about how hilarious this movie is, I finally rent it atthe video store and for 75 minutes maybe I laughed 3 times. Thismovie, a collection of skits that make fun of television is anincoherrent mess. The jokes fall flat, the humor deals withissues from the 1970's that just aren't relevant anymore, andthe jokes go on way too long (almost like the new SNL skits thepast few years). Yeah, Chevy Chase is in this but maybe of allabout 1 or 2 minutes. I liked the fact that this was veryraunchy and had nudity galore but couldn't it be funny? Doyourself a favor and rent Kentucky Fried Movie which is a farsuperior film made in the
