The most self-indulgent movie I have every had the misfortune torent. Unwatchable. Much of the movie is obviously improvised,and not well. It looks like Toback took the first take ofeverything. The movie gets good for a couple of minutes whenRobert Downey Jr. shows up, then goes to hell again realquickly.
