Battleship Potemkin is a celluloid masterpiece. The direction ofEisenstein is truly a sight. The film chronicles a ship of disgruntledsailors who are tired of being mistreated by their superior officers.Eventually, the sailors finally have enough of the abuse and send theofficers packing. During this time period, there was a shortage of filmstock in the Soviet Union. The goverment wanted to get their messageout to the people so they started a National Film Company and one ofthe members was Sergei Eisenstein. The films were shot on minisculebudgets and the shortage of film stock forced Eisentein to be carefuland selective with the footage that he shot. In the end, Eisenstein hadto reuse footage in order to make a feature length picture.The most famous of the action set pieces in this film is the muchtalked about massacre on the steps. This scene was spoofed in Bananas and most recently in Brian De Palma's The Untouchables. If you want tolearn film-making, I strongly advise you to watch Battleship Potemkin.It's one of the essentials.A+
