Oh, my gosh...I thought CBS primetime television shows were theworst things Gerald McRaney appeared in...Four people are experimented on by a crazed mind controlcomputer. That's it, don't rent it.I saw this under one of its many titles- "Grey Matter," and it isperhaps one of the worst films of recent memory. The otherreviews are right, it is awful. Never have so many establishingshots appeared onscreen, NEVER. The cast is awful, the directionis awful, and the script is awful. I cannot stress how awful this is. Avoid it like you would smallpox.This is rated (PG) for physical violence, some gun violence, mildgore, some profanity, and some adult situations
