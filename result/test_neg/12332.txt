An interesting concept turned into carnage...My first seeing feature from Geoffrey Wright (Romper Stomper), When i first took interest in it, it seemed at the time an interesting concept...Shakespere + Aussie Film + Gothic setting + Melbourne GanglandA very odd mixed that turned into a disastrous piece of Aussie cinema that gives my country a bad name...Pros: -Interesting conceptCons: -Waste of a good cast -Stuffed and stupid plot -Crooked camera angles -Not much variety of locations -Crap use of Shakespearian diologueOverall: Australia's worst attempt of a Shakespere film, Stick to Baz Lurhman...or Romper Stomper (WARNING: That film is dangerous)
