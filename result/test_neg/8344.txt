So it isn't an epic, but for people experiencing anything similar(sibling suicide) it might be an interesting way of therapy. Animaginative narrative and some fine acting makes it time wellspent. For some reason, it hasn't really caught on in the audience,something I do believe is a result of the main theme. Why did shecommit suicide? Clearly, this is hardly something that USmoviegoers will flock to, had it been an European production itprobably would have reached its audience in a much greaterextent. It is however, a movie that although the realism tainted by ashimmering romanticized glow, gives the viewer a whole heartedimpression.
