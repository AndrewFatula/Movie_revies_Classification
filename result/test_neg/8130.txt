After watching KHAKEE i felt i'll get to watch another good film but sadly The film is a joke and actually trying hard to introduce Aryeman Afterall his father Keshu is the producerRKS spoke so highly about the film during promotions, saying the film has meat unlike films released that time, I wonder which films was he talking aboutThe film is actually a typical Masala film with loads of comedy, romance, action everything jumbledThe ease at which the kids kidnap the family, is one of the funniest parts ever, Imagine kids kidnapping Dawood's familyThe end is a complete jumble mumble with sudden change of characterizationRKS gives his weakest film till date, except some Bachchan scenes the film is a boreMusic is boringAmitabh tries to give the role his all, he does his part well, though not his best though he contorts his face too much when pulling a trigger and does a weird look while smoking the cigar His dubbing too isn't matched properly at timesAkshay is there for some minutes and just repeats his act and hamsAryeman seems expressionless, tries too hard but overdoes it in some scenesBhumika emerges the best of the lotThe rest are okay
