Not only Why? But "What were they thinking?" This must have been somesort of payback to Gus Van Sant, because this is one of those odd moviesthat never should have been (re) made. It purports to be Hitchcocks filmframe by frame, but without the magic or the tension or the great filmmaking. Rent the original instead, spare yourself.
