Now i like Johnny Vegas which is a good start, I also enjoy toilet humourSuch as Young Ones and Bottom etc. This however failed to bring even asmall smile to my face. The story follows Johnny around after his wifechucks him out (how he got his good looking wife and kid i dont know) as he attempts to shag anything that moves. Failing normally. I was looking forward to this but found it to be totally boring and a wasteof my time altogether. Unless you are stuck for something to do for 90 mins apart from wash the car then dont bother.....
