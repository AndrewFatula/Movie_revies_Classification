People call this a comedy, but when I just watched it, I laughedonly once. I guess the problem is that I first saw it when I was 14,and I wasn't old enough to understand that it wasn't meant to betaken seriously. There were quite a few scenes that were meantto be funny, but I cared too much about the characters to laugh atthem.I suggest that you watch this film next time you're falling in love,and try to take it seriously. I think you'll find that, despite a few sillyflaws, it's one of the most moving love stories you've ever seen.
