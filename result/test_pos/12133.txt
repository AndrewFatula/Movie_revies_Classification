This superb 40's post war classic, tends to be overlooked thesedays. When it was released in 1945, it cleaned up at the 1946Oscars, mostly at the expense of `It's A Wonderful Life.' Both films were up for best film , bestdirector, and best actor, all won by Â‘Best Years'. Frederic March ,and Dana Andrews along with an amateur actor Harold Russell ( areal life soldier,who lost both hands in an explosion,) play thereturning soldiers, finding life is very different , from what theyremember. Myrna Loy is superb as March's wife, who has to keepthe family together while he has been away.The tear jerking scene where March and Loy are reunited is magnificent. All threemen find that they have problems readjusting to post war life, notleast Russell coming to terms with artificial hands, and his finance(Cathy O'Donnell ) trying to be too helpful. Sam Goldywn is quoted that he doesn't care if the film makes nomoney at all, as long as everyone in America sees the film ,so theywill appreciate what these men went through. If any film is worth 10 out of 10, it is this one.
