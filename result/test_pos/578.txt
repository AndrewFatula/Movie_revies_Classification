I just adore this film! I love all characters and I can watch it againand again...and I use to listen to the soundtrack again and again.Although I have seen it about two years after it was made and Ihave never been such youngster as Jip and company I canunderstand them and I love their stories. And if somebody thinks this film is crap, I disagree and I say it isfull of positive energy and friendship and love...and full of youth!The weekend has landed...enjoy it!
