Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema. Shot in the SouthernCalifornia desert using his patent faux documentary style, Watkinscreates a film like no other. He follows two groups of prisoners (onepre-sentenced the other post-sentenced) throughout the picture. After they're tried by a military tribunal, they have the choice of eitherserving out a prison sentence or they can participate in PunishmentPark (a grueling three day hike through the desert with nothing but theclothes on their backs) whilst being hunted down by local lawenforcement officers who use the park as a live action trainingground). I can't say enough about this movie. Sometimes it feels as ifyou're watching a real documentary. This is one of Peter Watkins mostaccessible films. I advise you to look out for it. You wont regret it!Highly recommendedA+
