For every fan of coming of age tales, this 3 hour adaptation of theSarah Waters novel is pure fun. Cinematic nods to Baz Luhrman'skinetic style, as well as to all those prim and proper period piecesever present on the BBC (where you're likely to have seen almostevery prominent member of this cast). It's rather bawdy and overthe top in spots, but that's just what the novel called for. The castis appealing and, in the cases of Anna Chancellor and HughBonneville, perfect. In the case of Rachel Sterling, as our heroineNan, you simply must overlook the fact that she's far too pretty toever be mistaken for a boy and run with it. It's a fantasy, after all. Some fans of the novel may be put out by the various changes incharacter (particularly that of Jodhi May's character, Florence), butthe changes all work toward the greater good of this teleplay andprovide an overall high quality entertainment value.
