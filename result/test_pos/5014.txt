Although the wonderful soda counter in the local drugstore nolonger exists, and the clothes are definitely l946 immediatepost-war vintage, and good and evil are easy to understand, andthose old planes are really dated, this movie will never be dated. The human adjustments and problems post-war, the beautifullove stories, the wonderful acting (especially Harold Russell andDana Andrews) are as moving today in 2002 as they were in l946. I was one of the young women who welcomed our marvelousveterans home from World War II. Like so many, my memories ofthe war years and the homecomings are as fresh today as if theytook place yesterday - this movie is very relevant for our times.
