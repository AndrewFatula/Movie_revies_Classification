I know, that's not what you expect from a film with this sort oflineage- it's a direct descendant of The Best Years of Our Livesand The Men... films dealing with men who are in the hospitaldealing with tragic circumstances. But this film is full of wonderfulsurprises and performances. It features stellar performances fromEric Stoltz and Helen Hunt (including a rather risque nude scene)and Wesley Snipes and William Forsythe. As Emanuel Levy wrotein his book Cinema of Outsiders (about the Independent filmmovement) "The Waterdance is coherant, attentive to detail, andunsentimental with a wicked down to earth humor- it' s at oncefunny and sad, and the entire cast is impressive." I wasextraordinarily moved by this film, it's hard hitting yes, but also hasvery tender moments and laugh out loud moments. A rare gem.
