This is Not a Love Song.My one word summary of this film would be `Excellent'.It probably won't appeal to the mass movie watching public  it's afilm that forces you to participate. You observe, think, and question.Comparisons could be made with Deliverance (Topic/Theme) andperhaps with The Blair Witch Project for overall filming style.However this film stands unique against both.The cinematography effects (solarisation, freeze frame, blur etc)have been seen before but they are used most effectively in thisfilm to underpin the natural tension of the story.Acting is raw, menacing and utterly believable.The real theme of the film is about friendship; the title really givesthe game away. It's probably not the kind of friendship that most ofus have experienced or indeed would want to.It is a love song.
