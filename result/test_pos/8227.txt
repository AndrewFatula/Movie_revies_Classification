I just cannot emphasize enough what a lovely movie this is. Justthe memory of this movie right now enchants me. If you want tosee a sweeping epic of a movie, with wonderful actors in vividscenery, with great dialogue, reminding you of what early Americacould have been like [what the world could have been like backthen]...well...I highly recommend this movie. Especially during atime of war and conflict in Iraq...when our American image is not atall what it used to be...this movie takes you back to a time when wewere just starting out. When being an American meant reallypicking yourself up by your bootstraps and getting going. Whenthe world was such an untamed and unknown place. Well, thismovie has that...and more. Enjoy.
