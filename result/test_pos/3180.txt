Anyone who appreciates fine acting and ringing dialogue will lovethis film. Taken from Ronald 'Taking Sides' Harwood, it's a funnyand ultimately excoriating analysis of a relationship between twovery 'actorly' types. Albert Finney is sublime as the despoticShakespearean actor who barely notices the world war ragingaround him, so intent is he on the crumbling fortunes of his theatrecompany and his own psychological and emotional breakdown.Tom Courtenay is matchless as Norman, the 'Dresser' of the title,whose apparent devotion turns out to be anything but selfless.Really a must see.
