This is not a bad film. It is not wildly funny, but it is interesting andentertaining. It has a few funny moments. Cher gives a goodperformance in a role that is very opposite her real-life self. Herperformance alone is worth the watch. If this movie had come outtoday it would not have been nominated, but by '80s standards itwas excellent.
