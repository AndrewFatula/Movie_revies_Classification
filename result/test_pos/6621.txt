The English are a little too evil, the Scots are a bit tooheroic.

And Brian Blessed chews the scenery in delightfulvillainy as Edward I.While lacking the budget needed to make the final battle trulyimpressive, they still marshalled an impressive crowd for theEnglish and Scottish armies. It is, according to filmmakers, the"largest filmed reconstruction of medieval battle ever staged inthe British Isles."Allowing for a few failings and shortcomings, the film stilldoes a convincing portrayal.
