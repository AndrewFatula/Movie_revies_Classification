This was the film that started that the cinematic love affairbetween the Jaundiced Eye crew and Matthew Ferguson. Hisability to portray RELATIVELY normal characters like Birkoff in"La Femme Nikita" is counter-balanced by his equally defthandling of weirdos like "Kane." One wishes that he would onlybe given more roles, bigger roles, and other, even more complexroles to assay to push the limits of his abilities. There werefour or five memorable scenes in this film, and Matthew Fergusonstole two of them from far more experienced actors. This filmitself is good, and it is worth watching on its own merits, butFerguson makes it a little extra special. His *ouevre* mayeventually show what the career of Anthony Perkins MIGHT havebeen like if he hadn't been typecast as "Norman Bates" so longago. "Kane" isn't quite as whacked-out as Norman, and far fewerpeople saw "Love and Human Remains than saw "Psycho," so we canhope that Ferguson will show us some hint of what Perkins MIGHThave been able to accomplish, had he been allowed to do so. . . .
