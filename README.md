# Movie_revies_Classification
practical implementation of simple neural network and tfidf algorithm, that takes text of review as an input and outputs probability that corresponding review is good.

Here in text_preprocess.py you can find training loop and implementation for Machine Learning algorithms like tfidf sentence vectorizer and simple 1 hidden layer neural network
on movie revies dataset, that consinst of 25000 training instance, each of instances contatins text of movie review and rating corresponding to that review

Trained model takes as input text of movie revie and outputs probability of that review is good review.

pipeline for trained movel and parameters for trained model you can find in ready_to_use and test it on your machine
